## SQL Library Manager
This project displays a collection of books that are in the database. In this app you can update an existing book, add a book or delete it. It also shows an error if the user tries to visit the page where the book does not exist, or if there is an error in the server.

## Skills and techniques required to complete the project
In this project I used Express which is a Nodejs framework to create routes. I used Sequelize which is a promise-based ORM (Object Relational Mapping) to do CRUD operations within express routes to manage data in the database.
